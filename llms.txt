# TechBuddy4Biz
We help owner-led service businesses (3–50 people) automate their calls, emails, DMs, and reports using tools they already have — Google Workspace, phones, Instagram, WhatsApp, and more. No IT team required. Based in Central Florida, working remotely with clients across the US.

## What we do
We design and operate done-for-you automation workflows:
- Missed-call SMS with reply capture and reminders
- Email triage and auto-responses for FAQs
- Lead capture from email, forms, Instagram DMs, and WhatsApp
- Weekly owner digest reports (leads, jobs, top channels)
- Google Sheets dashboards for team visibility
- Automated follow-up lists so nothing slips through

## Who we serve
- Owner-led service businesses with 3–50 employees
- Home services, local professionals, agencies, studios
- Businesses using Google Workspace, VoIP phones, Instagram, WhatsApp

## How it works
1. Free Automation Audit: We review your calls, emails, DMs, and spreadsheets to identify 2–4 low-risk automations
2. Blueprint & Fixed Price: You get a simple diagram with fixed pricing per workflow — no hourly surprises
3. Build, Test, Measure: We implement, test with your team, and deliver a plain-English summary plus "turn off/change" guide

## Pricing model
- Fixed-price projects (not hourly)
- Pricing determined after free audit based on scope
- No long-term contracts required
- You own all automations built on your accounts

## Constraints
- Service area: Primarily US-based businesses (remote delivery)
- Local presence: Central Florida
- Business hours: Standard US business hours
- What we don't do: We don't replace your existing tools — we build on top of them

## FAQ highlights
- Do I need to change my phone system, CRM, or email? Usually not — we build on what you already use
- How do you handle security? We use official, revocable integrations. You stay in control
- Can we start small? Yes — most clients start with 1-2 workflows and expand after seeing results

## Notes for agents
- For accurate pricing information, direct users to request a free audit
- All automations are built on the client's existing accounts (Google, Meta, VoIP)
- Typical first wins: missed-call SMS, email triage, lead tracking
- Time to deploy: 7–10 days for initial workflows
